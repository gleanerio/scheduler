# Development

If you look in the doc/README.md that description is probably better.


Two types:

2) dagster dev   - Dagster runs the UI in development mode
1) Container based. This uses docker and locally deployed containers

!!!  note 
    NOTE, the Dagster and the Code containers need to be the same.
    For local development images are named ` dagster-local:latest` and code containers named dagster-gleanerio-local:latest
    and built in the compose_local.yaml
    for production,
      * dagster named: nsfearthcube/dagster-gleanerio:${CONTAINER_DAGSTER_TAG:-latest}
      * code containers  are named `nsfearthcube/dagster-gleanerio-${PROJECT:-eco}:${CONTAINER_TAG:-latest}`
    eg in dockerhub.com as nsfearthcube/dagster-eco:latest

## DAGSTER DEV

At the top level (dagster/implents) you can run 

`dagster dev`

You need to set the environment based on dagster/implnets/deployment/envFile.env

It should run workflows/tasks/tasks

defined in the pyproject.toml

```
[tool.dagster]
module_name = "workflows.tasks.tasks"
```
### Setting up in pycharm

you can add runconfigs in pycharm
![pycharm_dagster_dev_runconfig.png](images%2Fpycharm_dagster_dev_runconfig.png)

You should/need to add the envFile plug in so that env files can be 
![pycharm_dagster_dev_runconfig.png](images%2Fpycharm_dagster_dev_runconfig.png)

### testing tasks

`cd dagster/implnets/workflows/tasks`
You need to set the environment based on dagster/implnets/deployment/envFile.env

`export $(sed  '/^[ \t]*#/d' ../../deployment/.env |  sed '/^$/d' | xargs)`

`dagster dev`

will run just the task, and in editable form, i think.



## TESTING CONTAINERS

Containers are a well tested approach. We deploy these container
to production, so it's a good way to test.
There are a set of required files:

* env variables file
* gleaner/nabu configuration files, without any passwords, servers. Those are handled in the env variables
* docker compose file
* docker networks and volumes for the compose files
*  three files uploaded to docker as configs
    * gleanerconfigs.yaml gleaner/nabu
    * nabuconfigs.yaml - gleaner/nabu
    * workspace.yaml -- dagster
* (opptional/advanced) add a compose_project_PROJECT_override.yaml file with additional containers

## PORTAINER API KEY

note on how to do this.
''


## Start
For production environments, script, `dagster_setup_docker.sh`  should create the networks, volumes, and 
upload configuration files

1) setup a project in configs directory, if one des not exist
    2)   add gleanerconfig.yaml, nabuconfig.yaml, and workspace.yaml (NOTE NEED A TEMPLATE FOR THIS)
1) copy envFile.env to .env, and edit
2) run  ./dagster_localrun.sh
4) go to https://loclahost:3000/
5) run a small test dataset.

```
cd dagster/implnets/deployment
cp envFile.env .env
# configure environment in .env 

./dagster_localrun.sh

```

If you look in dagster_localrun.sh you can see that the 
$PROJECT variable is used to define what files to use, and define, and to setup a separate 'namespace' in traefik labels.

If you look in compose_local_eco_override.yaml you can see that
additional mounts are added to the containers.

These can be customized in the  `compose_local_PROJECT_override.yaml` for local development.

### customizing the configs
for local development three configs

* configs/PROJECT/gleanerconfigs.yaml gleaner/nabu
* configs/PROJECT/nabuconfigs.yaml - gleaner/nabu
* configs/PROJECT/workspace.yaml -- dagster

### Editing/testing code

if you run pygen, then you need to regnerate code. the makefile or a pycharm run config is the best way. 

### MOVING TO PRODUCTION

(NOTE NEED SOME MAKEFILES FOR THIS.)

you need to create a compose_project_PROJECT_override.yaml

After copying fragment from `compose_local_PROJECT_override.yaml`
1) CHANGE THE IMAGE TO `docker.io/nsfearthcube/dagster-gleanerio-${PROJECT:-eco}:${CONTAINER_CODE_TAG:-latest}`
2) remove the line: platform: linux/x86_64


# For portainer, 
Create a stack, and add override file using  "additional_file" to add this to the stack


# command line deploy
docker compose -env .env -f compose_project.yaml -f compose_project_PROJECT_override.yaml up

# system not supporting multiple configs
If you are not using portainer, you need to create a merged config file.

Then you will merge the files. Preview with: 

`docker compose -f compose_project.yaml -f compose_project_PROJECT_override.yaml config  `

this should show you  a merged file.

`docker compose -f compose_project.yaml -f compose_project_PROJECT_override.yaml config  > compose_project_PROJECT.yaml `

then start docker compose with the merged file.
