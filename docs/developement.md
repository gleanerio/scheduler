# Scheduler Developement in Dagster

!!! Note 
    add [envfile](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7861-envfile) plug in to PyCharm to allow for easy debugging to code

## About

The following is a description of the steps and requirements for
building and deploying the docker based workflow implemented in 
dagster.

when developing, you can use `dagster dev`
you need to have the environment variables defined, so it's easist to do in a
Pycharm run shell script.

You can use a python module, dagster 
with option dev
load the runConfiguration dagster_eco_debug.run.xml





### Template files

The template files define the Dagster Ops, Jobs and Schedules.  From these
and a GleanerIO config file a set of Python scripts for Dagster are created in
the output directory. 

These only need to be changed or used to regenerate if you wish to alter the 
execution graph (ie, the ops, jobs and schedules) or change the config file.
In the later case only a regeneration needs to be done.

There are then Docker build scripts to build out new containers.  

See:  [template](./implnets/src/implnet-example/templates)

## Steps to build and deploy

The deployment can be tested locally using docker.
The production 'containers' are built with a github action, or using a makefile.

This describes the local and container deployment
We use portainer to manage our docker deployments.

1) move to the the deployment directory
2) copy the envFile.env to .env 
3) edit the entries.
4) for local, `./dagster_localrun.sh`
5) go to http://localhost:3000/

To deploy in portainer, use the deployment/compose_project.yaml docker stack.

### docker compose Configuration:
1) there are three files that need to be installed into docker configs. 

| file               | local                               | stack | note                     |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------| ------ |--------------------------|
| workspace          | configs/PROJECT/worksapce.yaml      | env () | used by dagster          |
| gleanerconfig.yaml | configs/PROJECT/gleanerconfigs.yaml | env () | needs to be in portainer |
| nabuconfig.yaml    | configs/PROJECT/nabuconfigs.yaml    | env () | needs to be in portainer |
2) 

## Editing Template

you can edit implnets/template

then deploy with

`pygen.py -cf ./configs/eco/gleanerconfig.yaml -od ./generatedCode/implnet-eco/output -td ./templates/v1 -d 7 ``

If you are running using dagster_localrun.sh 
1) go to the deployment at http://localhost:3000/locations
2) click 'reload on gleaner@project_grpc'
3) then if code is correct, then you will be able run the changed [workflows](http://localhost:3000/overview/jobs)

(TODO NEEDS MORE
)



### Environment files

1) cp deployment/envFile.env .env
2) edit
3) `export $(cat .env | xargs)`
export $(cat .env | xargs)
``` bash

# Implementation Networks

This ([https://github.com/sharmasagar25/dagster-docker-example](https://github.com/sharmasagar25/dagster-docker-example)) 
is an example on how to structure a [Dagster] project in order to organize
the jobs, repositories, schedules, and ops. The example also contains
examples on unit-tests and a docker-compose deployment file that utilizes a
Postgresql database for the run, event_log and schedule storage.

This example should in no way be considered suitable for production and is
merely my own example of a possible file structure. I personally felt that it
was difficult to put the Dagster concepts to use since the projects own examples
had widely different structure and was difficult to overview as a beginner.

The example is based on the official [tutorial].

## Folders

* build:  build directives for the docker containers
* configs
* src
* tooling

## Requirements

At this point it is expected that you have a valid Gleaner config file named
_gleanerconfig.yaml_ located in some path within the _configs_ directory.

## Building the dagster code from templates

The python program pygen will read a gleaner configuration file and a set of 
template and build the Dagster code from there.  

```bash
python pygen.py -cf ./configs/nsdf/gleanerconfig.yaml -od ./src/implnet-nsdf/output  -td ./src/implnet-nsdf/templates  -d 7
```


## Running 

There is an example on how to run a single pipeline in `src/main.py`. First
install the dependencies in an isolated Python environment.

```bash
pip install -r requirements
```

The code built above can be run locally, though your templates may be set up 
to reference services and other resources not present on your dev machine.  For 
complex examples like these, it can be problematic.  

If you are looking for some simple examples of Dagster, check out the directory
examples for some smaller self-contained workflows.  There are good for testing
things like sensors and other approaches. 

If you wish to still try the generated code cd into the output directory
you specified in the pygen command.

Then use:

```bash
dagit -h ghost.lan -w workspace.yaml
```

## Building

```bash
 podman build  -t  docker.io/fils/dagster:0.0.24  .
```

```bash
 podman push docker.io/fils/dagster:0.0.24
```



# Appendix

## Setup


![orchestration](images/orchestrationInit.svg)

## Docker API sequence

![sequence](../docs/images/sequence.svg)


## Appendix

### Portainer API setup

You will need to setup Portainer to allow for an API call.  To do this look 
at the documentation for [Accessing the Portainer API](https://docs.portainer.io/api/access)

## Notes

Single file testing run

```bash
 dagit -h ghost.lan -f test1.py
```

* Don't forget to set the DAGSTER_HOME dir like in 

```bash
 export DAGSTER_HOME=/home/fils/src/Projects/gleaner.io/scheduler/python/dagster
```

```
dagster-daemon run
```

Run from directory where workspace.yaml is.
```
dagit --host 192.168.202.159
```


## Cron Notes

A useful on-line tool:  [https://crontab.cronhub.io/](https://crontab.cronhub.io/)

```
0 3 * * *   is at 3 AM each day

0 3,5 * * * at 3 and 5 am each day

0 3 * * 0  at 3 am on Sunday

0 3 5 * *  At 03:00 AM, on day 5 of the month

0 3 5,19 * * At 03:00 AM, on day 5 and 19 of the month

0 3 1/4 * * At 03:00 AM, every 4 days
```


## Indexing Approaches

The following approaches

* Divide up the sources by sitemap and sitegraph
* Also divide by production and queue sources

The above will result in at most 4 initial sets.

We can then use the docker approach

```
./gleanerDocker.sh -cfg /gleaner/wd/rundir/oih_queue.yaml  --source cioosatlantic
```

to run indexes on specific sources in these configuration files.
