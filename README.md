# Scheduler


## About

This repo is focused on the use of Dagster to build out code and Docker containers
to run the Gleaner and Nabu packages for indexing websites with JSON-LD based
structured data on the web.


Details of the approach can be found in the [github io](https://earthcube.github.io/scheduler/).

NOTE: Generate code brach v0_generated_code branch
This is the original code that utilized a generate code approach to build the workflows. 
v0_generated_code is where gleaner and nabu config file updates should be done when using the original code
